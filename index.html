  <p class="aboutMe"> Hello! My name is Summer, like the season. Welcome to my website!* 

  There are a lot of things I like to do, some of which are showcased on the links below. I've spent the most time with photography - I got my first camera at the age of 8, and have been taking pictures ever since! But, there are plenty of other interests I've explored since then, such as artisan coffee, music/radio broadcasting, film, and most recently front-end development! And, if I know and like you well enough, I'm known to mix a pretty good cocktail. 

  I'm currently based in New York City. If you'd like to contact me, you can reach me via e-mail:

  <b> e-mail: </b> srainrizzo@gmail.com

  I'll leave the rest of getting to know me to you. Have a nice day! :^}


  <p class="aboutMe"> * Please, bear in mind that this website is a work in process! I am currently teaching myself front-end development, and building this site from the ground-up is my first project. I have a lot of plans in the works, so stay tuned! </p>
