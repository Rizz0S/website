  	<div class="description"> "The Castillos" is a short documentary film I made in the spring of 2018 while living in Austin, Texas. It is a portrait piece of an elderly Mexican-American couple who have lived in Austin all of their lives. Since 1979, they've owned a house on one of the busiest streets on the east side, E. Cesar Chavez. East Austin is a rapidly changing community with a strong cultural history, some of which is sadly fading away as development in the area moves forward. They're an amazing couple with rich experiences and I'm grateful for the opportunity to preserve and share them with others.

	<div class="description"> "The Self-Efficacy of a Flower" is an earnest attempt at expressing my personal experience living with - and trying to come to terms with recovering from - an eating disorder. It is certainly the most intimately I've ever connected with a project, and was exceedingly difficult to make. I have mixed feelings about it, still, and think I always will; it manifests so many of my insecurties, strengths, and weaknesses - both percieved and otherwise. Despite the complexitites, I'm still proud of it as a piece, and myself for committing to it. If you or anyone you know is struggling with an eating disorder, I urge compassion in every direction. It is deserved!
